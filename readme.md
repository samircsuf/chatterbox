CPSC 473 - Web Front-End Engineering for Internet Applications
Assignment 9 - Spring 2017
==========================
Section 2 due April 17.  Section 1 due April 19.

In this assignment, you will start a new application, Chattrbox, and work with Node.js to build a custom back-end.

Complete the following:
=======================
* Work through Chapter 15 to set up the chattrbox directory and create index.js.
* Test your code by adding a new page to the chattrbox/app/ directory and verifying that it is served correctly.
* Work through Chapter 16 to create websockets-server.js, install wscat, and test the results.
* Begin working through Chapter 17 to install Babel and related utilities, but stop when you finish the section Running the build process on p. 333.
* If you load the Chattrbox page with the DevTools console visible as in figure 17.12, in addition to "Hello ES6!" you should see an error message similar to the following:
* Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type text/plain: "http://localhost:3000/stylesheets/styles.css".
* Eliminate the error by completing the SIlver Challenge: Providing a MIME Type Dynamically from Chapter 15.
* Push the contents of your chattrbox directory into a new public GitHub repository
